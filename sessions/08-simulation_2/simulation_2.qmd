-   [**Individual discrete time state transition simulation**]{.underline}
-   Time to event modelling
-   Discrete event simulation without capacity constraints
-   Discrete event simulation with capacity constraints

## Why simulate a state transition model?

Enables flexibility without state state explosion

Transitions, costs, health outcomes can depend on complex functions of

-   Simulation time

-   Time in health state

-   Prior health states

-   Baseline characteristics

## Tracking individuals

For each variable, use $n_i \times n_t$ matrices, or $n_i \times (n_t+1)$, where:

-   $n_i$ is the number of individuals

-   $n_t$ is the number of cycles.

**Setup** (building on our CSTM notation)**:**

-   $M_m[i,t]$ matrix gives state of individual $i$ during cycle $t$

-   $M_c[i,t]$ matrix gives costs accrued by individual $i$ during cycle $t$

-   $M_q[i,t]$ matrix gives the QALYs experienced by individual $i$ during cycle $t$

-   Make such matrices for any characteristic you wish to track over time

Open up `sicksicker_microsim_B.R`. We will walk through it together

## Simulate enough patients that simulation error is negligible

-   Discrete event simulation with capacity constraints

## Intensity functions

-   Events (transitions) can be modeled with intensity functions (hazard functions)
-   Intensity function $\lambda_{ij}(t)$ gives instantaneous risk of transition from state $i$ to $j$ at time $t$
-   Cumulative intensity function: $\Lambda_{ij}(t) = \int_0^t \lambda_{ij}(u) du$

## Credit

Much of this section is based on:

[*Discrete Event Simulation for Health Technology Assessment (2016) by Caro et. al.*](https://www.routledge.com/Discrete-Event-Simulation-for-Health-Technology-Assessment/Caro-Moller-Karnon-Stahl-Ishak/p/book/9780367737689)

## Discrete event simulation strengths

-   Model heterogeneous population\*

-   Time-varying parameters\*

\*same as microsim

-   Represent disease as continuous process

-   Model [**capacity-constrained**]{.underline} resources

-   Entity types interact (patient, provider, tumor, etc.)^+^

^+^In a limited way

## Key components

-   **Events:** instantaneous change to entity or system

-   **Entities:** person or thing that experiences events

    -   patients, providers, ambulance, etc.

-   **Attributes:** information specific to entity

    -   Age, health state, 'in service'

-   **Resources:** provide service and have fixed capacity

    -   Providers, exam room, operating room, ventillator, etc.

-   **Queues:** lists of entities waiting for resource

## DES in health vs. elsewhere

-   DES common for manufacturing, logistics, traffic engineering

-   Focus usually on **system-level outcomes**

    -   Production volume, wastage, resource utilization, processing time

-   Health applications focus more on **entities'** state and pathway (patients)

    -   Often track more entity-level attributes

## Examples of events

![](figs/des_event_examples.png)

## Event graph

![](figs/DES-event-graph.png)

Arrows show sequence of events.

## Discrete events but continuous time

-   Events are instantaneous

-   Time between events usually sampled from distribution

-   State of system updated each time an event occurs

-   Unlike discrete time models with a constant cycle length, the "step size" varies depending on the time between events

    -   "Next-event-time-advance"

## Attributes

-   Some assigned at baseline and not changed (e.g., sex), others updated by events (e.g., cumulative costs, blood pressure)

-   Probability & timing of events can depend on attributes

## Example: time to competing events

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Events can have different distributions
time_to_checkup = rep(1, 15) # Always 1 year apart
time_to_polyp = rexp(n=15, rate = 1.5) # Sampled from distribution
# The clock goes until the next one occurs
time = pmin(time_to_checkup, time_to_polyp)
event=ifelse(time_to_checkup<time_to_polyp, "checkup","polyp developed")
cat(paste0("i: ", 1:15, "   event: ", event, "   time: ", time, "\n"))
```

## Global variables

-   Track the state of the [**system**]{.underline}

-   Memory-efficient (vs. individual attributes)

-   Some applications track only global variables

![](figs/attribute-vs-global-variable.png)

## Global variable examples

![](figs/global_variable_examples.png)

## Time

-   Pre-specify total simulation time, run until reach

-   Entities enter (are created) and exit at various times

-   Capacity constrained resources are "seized" and "released" by entities

    -   Entities must queue if all resources are seized
    -   This is the interaction between entities!
