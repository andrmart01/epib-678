Most course materials are available here on the public github site. Material for each class sessions is subject to change up until the session occurs.

For enrolled students only, the McGill Mycourses page is used to access readings and code samples assigned before each class (in the CONTENT tab), submit deliverables (in the ASSIGNMENTS tab), and recieve grades and feedback.

The Syllabus is available in [an HTML version](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/altonrus/epib-678/blob/main/syllabus/epid-678_syllabus.html) and a [PDF version](https://github.com/altonrus/epib-678/blob/main/syllabus/epid-678_syllabus.pdf)
