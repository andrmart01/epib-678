# A. Simulated decision tree

In this section, you will implement an adapted version of the simulated decision tree from my papers about transfusion-transmitted Zika virus, discussed in class (Used in [Russell et. al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-2238), [Russell et. al. 2021](https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10729-021-09557-1), and [Russell 2022](https://doi.org/10.7326/M20-6879)). You will employ two variation reduction techniques: simulating outcomes on the same cohort across each scenario and conditional Monte Carlo, to improve the efficiency of the analysis. Lets get started!

We will assess a hypothetical pathogen inactivation technology that reduces the risk of transfusion-transmitted Zika by 95% and costs \$18 per component transfused. As depicted below, the full simulation model consider adverse events to the transfusion recipient, their sexual partner, and an infant born to the transfusion recipient (if pregnant at the time of transfusion) or sexual partner (if pregnant at the time of sexual transmission). However, we're going to ignore sexual partners and only account for adverse outcomes experienced by the transfusion recipients and their future child, if pregnant. We will also simplify by ignoring cost and QALY discounting, as well as productivity loss due to illness or death. I've also inflated the probability of Guillain-Barre Syndrome so that we can get a stable solution while simulating a smaller number of transfusion recipients.

![](simulated_decision_tree_zika.png)

Model parameters are provided in an Excel file. This chunk reads in and displays the parameters. Note that some parameters are age specific. For a transfusion recipient whose age is X, their parameter would correspond to the row with the largest value in `age_lower` that is less than or equal to X. Parameters that do not vary by recipient age are entered only once and have 0 as the age_lower.

```{r}
t_params <- read_excel("params_assign3.xlsx", sheet="params")
t_params |>
  flextable() |>
  merge_v(j=c(1, 2, 3)) |> #Merge cells in first column with same value (group probabilities, costs, etc.)
  set_formatter(Value = label_comma()) |>
  theme_box() |> #Apply a theme for aesthetics
  autofit() #automatically set column widths to reasonable values
```

I've written this block of code for you. It puts the parameters into a named list `l_params` , you can access them by calling `l_params$PARAMETERNAME`. Note that parameters that depend on age are in the list as a tibble instead of as a single value.

```{r}
# Put parameters into named list l_params
params_freq_table <- table(t_params$rname)
l_params <- list()
for (param in names(params_freq_table)){
  if(params_freq_table[param]== 1){
    l_params[param]<-t_params[t_params$rname==param,]$value
  } else {
    l_params[[param]]<-tibble(
      "age_lower" = t_params[t_params$rname==param,]$age_lower,
      "value" = t_params[t_params$rname==param,]$value
    )
  }
}
```

## Sample cohort and baseline characteristics

In this code chunk, you should read in the file `transfusion_cohort.csv` and randomly sample 3,000 transfusion recipients. We also want to add a new column `age`, which assign an interger age to each transfusion recipient that is equally likely to be the age from the `age_group` column or any year up to four years older (e.g., if `age_group=45`, the recipient's age should be 45, 46, 47, 48, or 49 with equal probability (equivalent to adding a random integer between 0 and 4 to age_group).

```{r sample-recipients}
# Read in dataset
t_transfusion_cohort <- NA

# Sample 3,000 recipients (uncomment once t_transfusion_cohort loaded)
set.seed(500)
#t_sim_cohort <- sample_n(t_transfusion_cohort, 3000, replace = F)

# Assign their age (equally likely to be any integer age within age group)
# t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
#   mutate(age = NA)
```

### Baseline post-transfusion survival (done for you)

::: callout-note
## I have completed this section for Winter 2026, since the added discrete event simulation component below includes sampling other-cause mortality. You should only need to uncomment the code at the bottom of this section
:::

We want to simulate the recipients' baseline survival: the number of years they will live post-transfusion assuming no transfusion-transmitted infection. Since post-transfusion survival data based on age and component mix transfused were not available for the US, survival is estimated with what I call a "Frankenstein approach". The estimate combines 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year post-transfusion survival estimates from a US insurance claims analysis published in 2003 by Kleinman et. al., which is broken out only by 3 age groups, with multipliers derived from post-transfusion survival data from the SCANDAT database based on age and the number of red blood cell (RBC), platelet (PLT) and plasma (FFP) components transfused. The Kleinman US-based post-transfusion survival data are in an Excel sheet; well load those parameters as `t_US_survival`. The multipliers from SCANDAT are in another Excel sheet; we'll load those as `t_SCANDAT_mult`. We also include background other cause mortality based on a lifetable, which we'll read in as `t_ocm`.

```{r}
#Read in other cause mortality table and display first few rows
t_ocm <- read_excel("params_assign3.xlsx", sheet="other_cause_mortality") |>
  setDT()
t_ocm |> head() |> flextable()
#Read in SCANDAT mortality multiplier table and display first few rows
t_SCANDAT_mult <- read_excel("params_assign3.xlsx", sheet="SCANDAT_death_multipliers") |>
  setDT()
t_SCANDAT_mult |> head() |> flextable()
#Read in US post-transfusion survival data and display first few rows
t_US_survival <- read_excel("params_assign3.xlsx", sheet="US_posttransfusion_surv") |>
  setDT()
t_US_survival |> head() |> flextable()
```

Next, we need a function to sample each transfusion recipient's survival using our 'Frankenstein method'. For each recipient (row) in `t_sim_cohort`, the function should first create a vector of the probability of surviving to year `i`; then, it should randomly sample a baseline survival duration (survival without transfusion-transmitted Zika) from this distribution. Complete this function using the information in the comments.

NOTE: this function could probably be made more efficient using vectorization.

```{r}
#Takes t_sim_cohort and uBaseline, calculates remaining life years and QALYs assuming no transfusion-transmitted Zika and adds these as additional columns to t_sim_cohort
# INPUTS
# t_sim_cohort: table of a (simulated) cohort of individuals, with columns 
#.    units_rbc, units_plt, units_ffp, and age
# u_baseline: Baseline (without Zika) utility, from parameter list
get_survival <- function(t_sim_cohort, uBaseline){
    
  t_sim_cohort$survival <- 0
    
  for (row in 1:nrow(t_sim_cohort)){
    #Preallocate v_survProb, a vector with the recipient's cumulative 
    #. survival probability (e.g., probability of surviving to post-
    #. transfusion year X). The vector length should be 100 minus their 
    #. age at the time of transfusion
    recip_age <- t_sim_cohort[row,]$age
    v_survProb <- c(NA)
    length(v_survProb) <- 100 - recip_age
  
    #SURVIVING YEAR 0
    #. Tidyverse was slow and I switched it to
    #. data.table, so I'm providing all the year 1
    #. code for you.
    
    #from t_US_survival, get the probabiltiy of surviving to post-
    #. transfusion year 1 based on the age at transfusion
    p_surv_unadjusted <- t_US_survival[year_posttransfusion==0 & 
                                         age_lower <= recip_age,][
                                           age_lower==max(age_lower), value]
    
    #use t_ocm to calculate the probability they DON'T die from another cause
    p_survive_OCM <- 1 - t_ocm[age== recip_age, annual_prob_death]
    

    # Extract SCANDAT survival multiplier based on recipient's age 
    #. and units transfused
    survival_multiplier <- t_SCANDAT_mult[RBC_lower <= t_sim_cohort[row,]$units_rbc &
                                          PLT_lower <= t_sim_cohort[row,]$units_plt &
                                          FFP_lower <= t_sim_cohort[row,]$units_ffp &
                                          age_lower <= recip_age,][
                                            age_lower == max(age_lower) &
                                            RBC_lower == max(RBC_lower) &
                                            PLT_lower == max(PLT_lower) &
                                            FFP_lower == max(FFP_lower),
                                            multiplier]

    
    #Calculate probability recipient survives to 1 year post-transfusion
    #No need to edit
    v_survProb[[1]]<- p_surv_unadjusted + 
      survival_multiplier*(p_survive_OCM - p_surv_unadjusted)
    
    #Calculate cumulative probability of surviving post-transfusion years 2-5
    #. Applying same adjustment to years 2-5 of the US survival data as you
    #. just did for year 1.
    for (i in 2:5){
      recip_age <- recip_age+1
      p_survive_OCM <-  1 - t_ocm[age== recip_age, annual_prob_death] 
      p_surv_unadjusted <-  t_US_survival[year_posttransfusion==i-1 & 
                                         age_lower <= recip_age,][
                                           age_lower==max(age_lower), value]
      
      v_survProb[i] <- p_surv_unadjusted + 
        survival_multiplier*(p_survive_OCM - p_surv_unadjusted)
    }
    
    #Beyond post-transfusion year 5, cumulative survival is based only 
    #. on the annual probablity of other cause death
    for(i in 6:length(v_survProb)){
      recip_age <- recip_age+1
      p_survive_OCM <- 1 - t_ocm[age== recip_age, annual_prob_death]
      v_survProb[i] <- v_survProb[i-1]*p_survive_OCM
    }
    
    #sample recipeint's survival (number of post-transfusion years) and add as a 
    #. column to t_sim_cohort
    #. I provide the calculation for you;
    #. see if you can figure out why this works
    survival <- sum(1-v_survProb > runif(1))
    t_sim_cohort[row,]$survival <- survival
  }
  
  #Add a column named 'baseline_QALYs' to t_sim_cort, based on the survival and uBaseline
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(baseline_QALYs = survival*uBaseline) #your code here
  
  return(t_sim_cohort)
}
```

Test it out: add survival to your cohort

```{r}
# # Uncomment and add the arguments
# t_sim_cohort <- get_survival(t_sim_cohort, uBaseline=l_params$uBaseline)
# 
# # Uncomment to take a look
# summary(t_sim_cohort$survival)
# summary(t_sim_cohort$baseline_QALYs)
```

### Pregnancy

We want to add two more columns: a variable `p_pregnant` containing the probability a recipient is pregnant based on their sex and age, and a binary variable called `isPregnant` where we simulate whether they are pregnant or not.

```{r}
getPregnant <- function(t_sim_cohort, #table with cohort we're simulating
                        l_params # our parameter list
                        ){
  
  #use l_params$p_recip_pregnant_by_age to get probability female
  #.  recipients are pregnant by age, assigning a probability
  #.  of 0 to male recipients
  #.  I did this for you
  setDT(t_sim_cohort)
  t_preg_by_age <- data.table(l_params$p_recip_pregnant_by_age)
  setnames(t_preg_by_age, 
           c("age_lower", "value"),
           c("age", "p_pregnant"))
  t_sim_cohort <- t_preg_by_age[t_sim_cohort, roll = Inf, on="age"]
  
  #overwrite with 0 if recipient is male
  t_sim_cohort[, p_pregnant:=ifelse(is_female==0,
                                    0,
                                    p_pregnant)]
  
  # Now we'll create a vector of ranom numbers the same length 
  #. as our recipients and use this to determine which 
  #. recipients are pregnant
  rand_pregnant <- NA
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(isPregnant = NA)
  
  return(t_sim_cohort)
}
```

Now apply your function to add the pregnancy variables `t_sim_cohort` and take a look at them.

```{r}
# Uncomment and add the arguments

# t_sim_cohort <- getPregnant(NA)

# Uncomment to take a look
# summary(t_sim_cohort$p_pregnant)
# summary(t_sim_cohort$isPregnant)
```

## Outcomes of transfusion-transmitted Zika

We first simulate outcomes assuming that Zika transmitted to the transfusion recipient, using a series of functions that take `t_sim_cohort` as an input, calculate some outcomes, append these to the table, and return it.

This section uses data.table rolling joins. Here is a useful guide on them: <https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/06/understanding-data-table-rolling-joins/>

```{r recipient-outcomes}
#Calculates recipient outcomes if transfusion-transmitted Zika occurs
recipient_outcomes_ttz <- function(t_sim_cohort, l_params){
  
  # Add age/sex-specific parameters to t_sim_cohort based on the
  #.  lookup tables stored in l_params
  setDT(t_sim_cohort) #The way I added uFlu male used data.table package's 
  #.  join, which is why I set the table to a data.table. Tidyverse methods were much slower
  
  #Get uFlu assuming recipient is male 
  t_uFluMale <- data.table(l_params$uFluMale)
  setnames(t_uFluMale, 
           c("age_lower", "value"),
           c("age", "uFluMale"))
  t_sim_cohort <- t_uFluMale[t_sim_cohort, roll = Inf, on="age"]
  
  #Extract uFlu assuming recipient is male 
  NA # your code here
  
  #add column uFlu (uFluFemale if is_female = 1; otherwise uFluMale)
  NA # your code here
  
  #Extract p_GBS_perm based on recipient's age
  t_GBS_perm <- data.table(l_params$p_GBS_perm)
  NA #your code here
  
  #Add columns to t_sim_cohort to track outcomes
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(flulike=F,
               GBS=F,
               GBS_perm=F,
               GBS_death=F,
               cost_zika_symptoms=0,
               QALYs_zika_symptoms=0)
  
  # Simulate whether flu-like symptoms or Guillain-Barre syndrom occur
  #.  I coded this part for you
  rand_recip <- runif(nrow(t_sim_cohort))
  
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(flulike = (rand_recip < l_params$p_flu_like_symptoms),
           GBS = (rand_recip > l_params$p_flu_like_symptoms & 
                    rand_recip <= l_params$p_flu_like_symptoms + l_params$p_GBS))
  
  # Simulate whether GBS was fatal or lead to permanent disability
  #.  based on the lookup table in l_params$p_GBS_perm if 
  #.  GBS==True (it should be 0 if GBS==F)
  #.  Then replace 0's in the mutate function with functions to simulate
  #.  whether permanent disability or death occur
  #.  remember: only recipients who experienced GBS can experience
  #.  permanent disability or death. You can achieve this
  #.  by multiplying your expression by GBS (0 for anyone without GBS).
  rand_GBS <- runif(nrow(t_sim_cohort))
  
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(GBS_perm = GBS*(rand_GBS < p_GBS_perm), 
           GBS_death = F) #replace F with your code 
  
  
  # Calculate costs and QALYs
  #.  I've done some of this for you; complete by replacing 
  #.  NAs with code that works properly
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(
      cost_zika_symptoms=case_when(
        GBS_death ~ NA,
        flulike ~ l_params$costFluR,
        GBS_perm ~ NA, #Note; l_params$costGBS_perm is per year of life remaining
        GBS ~ NA,
        T ~ 0), #otherwise no cost
      QALYs_zika_symptoms=case_when(
        GBS_death ~ 0,
        flulike ~ baseline_QALYs - (1-uFlu)*l_params$durationFlu/365,
        GBS_perm ~ NA, #experience uGBS for all remaining years
        GBS ~ NA, #experience uGBS for 1 year
        T ~ baseline_QALYs) #Otherwise same QALYs as baseline
    )
  return(t_sim_cohort)
  
}
```

Try this function on `t_sim_cohort`

```{r}
# t_sim_cohort <- recipient_outcomes_ttz(t_sim_cohort, l_params)
# str(t_sim_cohort)
```

We also need to simulate outcomes to the infant for any pregnant women transfused

```{r infant-outcomes}

infant_outcomes_ttz <- function(t_sim_cohort, l_params){
  
  # For pregnant recipients, simulate whether
  #. congenital zika syndrom occurs
  rand_CZS <- NA
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(
      CZS = F
    )
  
  # For recipients whose infant contracted congenital
  #. zika syndrom, calculate their outcome
  rand_CZS_stillbirth <- NA
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(
      CZS_stillbirth = F
    )
  
  # Add costs and infant_QALY_loss
  #. if CZS occurs, we incur a QALY toll
  #.  equivalent to the net present life expectancy of a newborn
  #.  regardless of whether CZS led to a stillbirth
  #.  or live birth with permanent disability
  #. (this is a pessimistic assumption but since
  #.  CZS is so rare it won't substantially impact
  #.  results)
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(
      #If stillbirth: cost_CZS = costStillBirth - costDelivery 
      #.   (stillbirth cheaper than deliviery)
      #If CZS live birth: cost_CZS = costCZS_birth+costCZS_lifetime 
      cost_CZS = NA, 
      QALY_toll_CZS = -1*l_params$CZS_QALYloss*CZS
    )
  return(t_sim_cohort)
}
```

Try this function on `t_sim_cohort`

```{r}
# t_sim_cohort <- infant_outcomes_ttz(t_sim_cohort, l_params)
# str(t_sim_cohort)
```

## Policies & cost-effectiveness

We will now write a function to calculate blood center costs and the probability of transfusion-transmitted Zika with and without pathogen inactivation

```{r}
#This function calculates the probability
#. of transfusion transmitted Zika (no edits needed)
getProbZika <- function(probZika=0.0001, 
                        units_rbc, 
                        units_plt, 
                        units_ffp,
                        l_params){
  p_neg_unit = 1 - probZika
  return(
    1 - (
      (1-l_params$p_transmit_RBC*(1-p_neg_unit^units_rbc))*
        (1-l_params$p_transmit_PLT*(1-p_neg_unit^units_plt))*
        (1-l_params$p_transmit_FFP*(1-p_neg_unit^units_ffp))
    ))}


# This function calculates outcomes under each policy scenario
#.  (blood center costs, probability of transfusion-transmitted Zika,
#.  total cost & QALYs for "do nothing" and "pathogen inactivation" scenarios)
getPolOutcomes <- function(t_sim_cohort, l_params, prev=0.0001){
  # Replace all the NAs
  
  # DO NOTHIING SCENARIO
  #. calculate cost to blood center
  #. and each recipient's risk of transfusion-
  #. transmitted Zika
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(
      cost_bloodCenter_doNothing = 0,
      p_TTZ_doNothing = NA)
  
  # PATHOGEN INACTIVATION
  #. calculate cost to blood center
  #. and each recipient's risk of transfusion-
  #. transmitted Zika
  #. costPathInact is per unit transfused (RBC+PLT+FFP)
  #. Calculate p_TTZ_pathInact using p_TTZ_doNothing and p_pathInact_prevent_TTZ
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(
      cost_bloodCenter_pathInact = NA, 
      p_TTZ_pathInact = NA) 
  
  # Calculate total costs and QALYs under each scenario
  #. USE CONDITIONAL MONTE-CARLO
  #.  blood center costs are incurred no matter what
  #.  cost_CZS and cost_zika_symptoms are incurred only
  #.  when tansfusion-transmitted Zika (TTZ) occurs
  t_sim_cohort <- t_sim_cohort |>
    mutate(
      tot_cost_doNothing = NA,
      tot_cost_pathInact = NA,
      tot_QALYs_doNothing = NA,
      tot_QALYs_pathInact = NA
    )
}
```

Finally, use the functions above to run `t_sim_cohort` through the simulation. Calculate the incremental costs, incremental QALYs, and cost-effectiveness of pathogen inactivation for preventing transfusion-transmitted Zika.
