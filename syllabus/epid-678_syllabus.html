<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-description">Course description</h2>
<p>Developing decision-analytic models to synthesize evidence and simulate the outcomes of strategies in public health and medicine, including health technology assessment and model-based economic evaluation. Methodologies include cohort state transition modelling, microsimulation, discrete event simulation, Bayesian model calibration, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, value of information analysis, and equity-informative modelling frameworks. Applications include disease screening, prevention, and treatment, public health strategy, and prioritization of health research.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop decision analytic models to inform health policy and clinical decisions</li>
<li>Understand and critically appraise model-based decision analyses</li>
<li>Create transparent reports of model-based decision analyses that conform to open science principles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Class meetings</strong> will be held 11:35am – 12:55am on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 2001 McGill College Ave in room #1128. Attendance is expected.</p>
<p><strong>Office hours</strong> will be held 2:30pm – 3:30pm on Mondays at 2001 McGill College Ave in room #1203. Students can take advantage of office hours to discuss assignments, projects, and readings or ask general career/research questions. All students are encouraged to attend. Most discussions take place openly so that other students can listen in or join in. Students who would like a private discussion should let the instructor know.</p>
</section>
<section id="target-audience" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="target-audience">Target audience</h2>
<p>The course is oriented towards PhD students and advanced Master’s students interested in applying model-based analyses of health policies, decisions, or technologies in research. Modelling skills developed in the course will also be useful for students interested in industry or government roles related to economic evaluation, policy modelling, health technology assessment, or health economics and outcomes research.</p>
</section>
<section id="prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The ideal preparation of this course includes (1) at least an introductory course in R or a similar programming language, (2) a course in probability, (3) a course in statistics. A course on economic evaluation such as PPHS 528 is not necessary but would provide helpful context. Prior experience programming in R is ideal, but students with solid experience in programming fundamentals (e.g., nested loops, functions, data structures) should be able to learn the R syntax and environment as they go. Students who lack a prerequisite other than programming may need to spend extra time on some course components but should be able to succeed in the course. Students without programming, or without training in either statistics or probability, should not take the course. To help make an informed decision on how well-prepared you are for the course, you may <a href="https://github.com/altonrus/epib-676/tree/main/assignments">attempt to complete assignment 0 early (available on Github)</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="readings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="readings">Readings</h2>
<p>Readings drawn from various sources are assigned before most class sessions as indicated in the schedule below. PDFs of the readings are available on myCourses. Some readings are tutorials with accompanying code, which you are encouraged to download and run. To get full credit for class engagement, students should come to class prepared to discuss the readings.</p>
<p>If &gt;20 pages are assigned for a given class, students may skim some of the material, particularly readings that are marked as ‘secondary.’ But students should be sufficiently familiar with each reading to quickly find relevant material as they work on assignments and their project.</p>
</section>
<section id="laptops-and-software" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="laptops-and-software">Laptops and software</h2>
<p>Students should bring a personal laptop to class. Please let the instructor know right away if this is a challenge so we can find a solution. Before the first session, students should install and configure the necessary software (R, RStudio, Quarto, git) <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/altonrus/epib-676/blob/main/sessions/01-introduction/get-set-up.html">using the ‘Setting up your software enviroment’ instructions from session 1</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="approach-to-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="approach-to-learning">Approach to learning</h2>
<p>The course provides hands-on experience applying course concepts early and often. The course has two phases with some overlap:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The methods phase (15 sessions)</strong> focuses on understanding methods and workflows and building programming skills. Readings are primarily pedagogical in nature, including tutorials with accompanied R code you can examine and run. Some class sessions will include running sample code on your own laptop. Six programming assignments will provide hands-on experience in coding a model-based decision analysis.</li>
<li><strong>The application phase (11 sessions)</strong> focuses on the use of decision analytic modelling to inform health policy and clinical practice. Students will be assigned a diverse set of applied modelling analyses as readings and hear from a variety of decision-analytic modellers in class sessions. Students will also analyze and present an existing open-source modelling study. For the course project, students will develop their own model-based decision analysis.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="assignments-evaluation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assignments-evaluation">Assignments &amp; evaluation</h2>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-programming-assignments-48">R programming assignments (48%)</h3>
<p>A series of time-intensive programming assignments will provide hands-on experience developing decision analytic modelling analyses. For each assignment, students will download a Zip file that contains a Quarto document from the <a href="https://github.com/altonrus/epib-676/tree/main/assignments">class Github site</a>. The Quarto document includes questions, instructions, and starter code. Students will complete the assignments by completing the code and answering questions. Once complete, students will render their Quarto document to an HTML file, which they upload to <a href="https://mycourses2.mcgill.ca/">myCourses</a> for grading.</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Simpler models (8%)</li>
<li>Decision trees, cost-effectiveness (8%)</li>

<li>Simulation (8%)</li>
<li>Differential equation models &amp; uncertainty analysis (8%)</li>
<li>Calibration, validation, and value of information (8%)</li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>Assessment:</strong></u> Students who correctly complete all components of the assignments will receive full marks. Partial credit will be awarded for components that contain errors but demonstrate at least partial understanding of how to program the relevant modelling concept. Out of fairness to all classmates, late assignments will be penalized 20% per day unless an exception is granted more than 2 days before the deadline or under exceptional circumstances. All assignments will be available at least 10 days before their deadline. Students should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start early</p></li>
<li><p>Read the whole assignment before you begin and feel free to go out of order</p></li>
<li><p>Spend some time on it each day for 3 or more days (instead of completing it in one sitting)</p></li>
<li><p>Work alone first, then discuss with classmates and/or the instructor (but you must write your own code and responses)</p></li>

</section>
<section id="course-project-36" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-project-36">Course project (36%)</h3>
<p>The default course project entails developing a decision-analytic model and use it to inform a decision from health policy or clinical practice. Students are encouraged to analyze a decision problem related to their own research and/or engage with domain experts outside the class when applicable. Other project topics, such as developing or assessing a novel method or using modelling methods for an application that is not a decision analysis, may be approved by the instructor on a case-by-case basic. Students are strongly encouraged to come to office hours to discuss their project with the instructor.</p>
